# Larry Croftâ€™s Adventures
A creative clone of the (first level of the) 1989 Atari game Chips Challenge.

## Simplifications
- 

## Levels
Levels are stored under the `src/main/resources/levels/` directory.
Level data is contained `level<number>.json` with any custom actor behaviour in a `.jar` archive of the same name.

## Implementation details
- Target Java 17 (OpenJDK)
- Gradle build tools and standard directory structure are used
